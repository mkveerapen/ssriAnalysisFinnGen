# SSRI Analysis in FinnGen 

This repository contains logs, codes, and some results from the R5 and R6 SSRI data that was previously run on Google Cloud (refinery access).

Work from this analysis has been previously presented at ASHG 2020 and WCPG 2020.

		YouTube (50:42 to 1:07:26): https://youtu.be/rlrTV1U5-9I?t=3043 

Slide deck from these presentations can be found in the `slideDeck` folder

For the remainder of the folders:

`drugIdentities` contains the files that were used to map drugs to the longitudinal FG data

`logs` are pdf files generated from logs that were kept from output and discussions in EverNote

**most importantly** `SSRIanalysis.R` is the master script that was used to interrogate the data where the entire longitudinal data was read onto R for subsequent analysis. The R script has annotations throughout. 

For plots and pdf outputs that were generated in R5 and R6, please view Kumar's personal Dropbox space (https://www.dropbox.com/sh/5e4l4i44atroxro/AAB2er9YWCk3rM1ysQD3OzZPa?dl=0)
